[Developed by the Chair ofÂ Air Quality and Particle Technology, headed by Prof. Dr. Jing Wang, at ETH Zurich](https://ie.ifu.ethz.ch/)

The codes are developed to visualize the 3d plume of the pollutants in urban area calculated by the [GRAL/GRAMM model](https://gral.tugraz.at/).
If the codes are utilized, please cite the following paper
